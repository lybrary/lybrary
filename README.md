# Lybrary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lybrary/lybrary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lybrary/lybrary)

## 1) Configure environment

* Ruby 2.3.1

Environment variables:
```
DB_HOST = Your database host
DB_USER = Your database user
DB_PASS = Your database password
DB_PORT = Your database port
RAILS_ENV = Production
SECRET_KEY_BASE = The secret key generated by rake
```

## 2) Install the application

* `bundle install` - Install packages
* `rails db:setup && rails db:migrate` - Configure the database

## 3) Run the application

* `rails server`

<!--### Requirements

* Vagrant for VM management
* Ansible for VM provisioning

### Vagrant setup steps

* `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` - Install the required ansible-galaxy roles.
* `vagrant up` - Bring up the vagrant box

_**Warning:** some default credentials for MySQL are stored in the Ansible provisioning files. These are not secure and should only be used for development purposes on a secured machine and throwaway VM. Do not use them for production values!_

### Run the app

* Set the following environment variables to their values for a MySQL database. If you're using Vagrant, this step can be ignored as a default is already set.

```
DB_HOST
DB_USER
DB_PASS
DB_PORT
```

* `bundle install` will install package dependencies.
* `rails db:setup && rails db:migrate` to setup the database.
* `rails s -b 0.0.0.0` will set it running on port 3000 in the vagrant box. You can then access it from `http://192.168.33.8:3000/` on your browser.
